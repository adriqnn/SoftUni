# Database Basics:

* Database Management Systems -> defined structure, CRUD and queries;
* Relational SQL DB -> structured into tables and relationships(vertiacal and harder to expand or scale);
* NoSQL DB -> holds collections of documents(key-value pairs)(horizontal and easy to expand or scale);
* DATABASE exercises;
