# Trees Representation and Traversal(BFS & DFS)

* Tree -> Abstract Data Structure that simulates hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes;
* Tree -> node, edge, root, leaf, branch, parent, child, sibling, ancestor, descendant, degree, path, distance, depth, level, height, width, breadth, forest, sub-tree;
* Tree -> node(structure that contains value or condition) - building block for a tree, edge - connection between nodes, root(prime ancestor) - the top most node;
* Tree -> parent - an immediate ancestor, child - a node connection moving away from the root, siblings - group of nodes with same parent;
* Tree -> ancestor - a node reachable moving from child to parent, descendant - node reachable from parent to child;
* Tree -> leaf - node with no children, branch - node with at least one child;
* Recursive Tree -> a single node is a tree, nodes have zero or multiple children that are also tres;
* Tree Traversal -> Depth-First Search(DFS)(Stack)(Recursion) and Breadth-First Search(BFS)(Queue)(Recursion);
* BFS -> from top to bottom - visits neighbours then children and so-on;
* DFS -> from bottom to right - visits descendants and then neighbours and their descendants and so-on;
