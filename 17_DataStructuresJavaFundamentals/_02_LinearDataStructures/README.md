# Linear Data Structures:

* Dynamic Arrays -> implements abstract data structure and uses array underneath; general complexities of the operations are O(1), O(n) and in some cases O(log n);
* Nodes -> building blocks of many structures, stores element and pointer to next/previous node;
* Stacks -> ADS implementation of Last In First Out(LIFO); Node based; complexities of the operations are O(1) and O(n);
* Queues -> ADS implementation of First In First Out(FIFO); Node based; complexities of the operations are O(1) and O(n);
* Linked List -> ADS with implementation based on nodes; single/double/reversed variants; complexities of the operations are O(1) and O(n);
