# Balanced Parentheses Documentation

Overview:

The task involves analyzing a sequence of parentheses to determine whether they are balanced. A sequence of parentheses is considered balanced if each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis in the correct order, and the intervals between them are also balanced.

Method:

The solve() method analyzes the provided sequence of parentheses and returns true if they are balanced and false otherwise. It implements the following logic:

* It uses a stack data structure to keep track of opening parentheses encountered while traversing the sequence.
* For each character in the sequence:
    If the character is an opening parenthesis ('(', '[', '{'), it is pushed onto the stack.
    If the character is a closing parenthesis (')', ']', '}'), it is compared with the top element of the stack:
        If they match and form a valid pair, the top element is popped from the stack.
        If they do not match or the stack is empty, the parentheses are unbalanced, and the method returns false.
* After iterating through all characters, if the stack is empty, it indicates that all opening parentheses have been properly matched with closing parentheses, and the method returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Example:

* For the input {[()]}, the method returns true since the parentheses are balanced.
* For the input {[(])}, the method returns false since the parentheses are unbalanced.
