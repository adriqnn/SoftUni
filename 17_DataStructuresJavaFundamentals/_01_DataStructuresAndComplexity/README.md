# Data Structures and Complexity

* Memory -> continuous and numbered(addressed) sequences of bytes;
* Memory Storage -> temporary(RAM) and permanent(ROM);
* byte -> one address in the memory;
* Memory Hierarchy -> cpu(registers) -> cpu(cache) -> random access(memory) -> disk(storage);
* Data Structure -> object which takes responsibility for data organization, storage and management in effective manner;
* Abstract Data Structures -> set of operations to be executed without the implementation itself;
* Data Structure implementation -> based on the ADS - defines the exact implementation of the methods;
* Algorithmic Complexity -> O(n), determine the computational time(cpu), memory space(ram) and communication(bandwidth);
* Algorithmic Analysis -> simplicity, accuracy and performance;
* Time Complexity -> worst-case, mid/average-case and worst-case;
* Typical Complexities -> constant - O(1); logarithmic - O(log n); linear - O(n); linearithmetic - O(n*log n); quadratic - O(n^2); cubic - O(n^3); exponential - O(n^n);
* Array Data Structure -> lightweight, built-in, fixed size and good foundation for other more complex structures;
* Data Structure Implementation -> array-based and node-based depending on the need of the structure;
