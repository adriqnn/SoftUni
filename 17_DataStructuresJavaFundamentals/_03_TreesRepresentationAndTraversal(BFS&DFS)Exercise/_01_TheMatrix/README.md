# The Matrix Documentation

Overview:

"The Matrix" is a problem - given a 2D array (matrix) of lowercase alphanumeric characters, a starting position defined by row and column indices, and a filling symbol. The task is to change every symbol in the matrix that meets specific conditions from the starting position.
Problem Statement

Approach:

The problem can be solved using either Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms. Both approaches involve traversing the matrix from the starting position, identifying connected symbols with the same value, and updating them to the fillChar.
