# Bits and Bitwise Operations:

* Bits -> smallest unit of data, activation on/off, 8 bits = 1 byte, kb, mb, gb, tb, pb & other;
* Numeral Systems -> positional number system, decimal numbers, binary numbers, hexadecimal numbers and other;
* Representation of Data -> Integers(signed(+ and -) and unsigned(+)), Real NUmbers(IEEE 754 technical standard and are stored as sequence of bits), Text(represented as characters - ASCII & UNICODE), Strings(arrays of characters);
* Bitwise Operations -> NOT(~), OR(|), AND(&) & XOR(^) also Bit Shifts;
* Binary file formats and Data compression;
* Bitwise Operations exercises;
