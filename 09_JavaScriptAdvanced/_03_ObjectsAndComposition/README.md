# Objects and Composition - Lecture

* Object -> collection of fields called properties that are a pair of key and a value; reference data type;
* Assigning and Accessing Properties -> accessing with dot(obj.name) or with brackets(obj['name']); can use destructuring to access needed properties with {and the names}; delete properties with 'delete';
* Objects as Associative Arrays -> object can be used as associative arrays(key-value pairs);
* Object Methods -> objects can store functions(function libraries); useful for public APIs;
* Object as Switch -> objects can be used instead of switch statements;
* Accessing Object Context -> using this preserves the parent object within objects;
* Object Composition -> combines simple objects into more complex objects for code reusability;
* Factory Functions with Reference -> creation functions that make objects that act like classes;
* Decorator Functions -> functions that add new data and bahaviour;
* JSON -> JavaScript Object Notation; data format, language independent and easy to understand;
* JSON Syntax Rules -> name/value pairs, separated by commas, curly brackets, square for arrays and double quotes("");
* JSON Methods -> parse, stringify & others;
