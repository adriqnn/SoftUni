# Classes and Attributes - Lecture

* Defining Classes -> structures for objects; classes contain data(properties and attributes) and actions(bahaviour); class declarations are not hoisted; classes start with new and constructor; this refers to the instance of the class;
* instanceof -> returns true if the object is instance of the class;
* Static Context -> static attributes and methods are class based and not instance based; this in the case can access only static members;
* Accessor Properties -> get/set are special functions to access class properties;
* DOM Classes -> all DOM objects are instances of standard DOM classes;
* DOM Methods and Properties -> addEventListener, appendChild, remove, children, parentNode, textContent, value & other; cloneNode, replaceWith, before, after, classList, getAttribute, setAttribute, removeAttribute, hasAttribute & other;
* Built-in Collections -> set, map, weakset, weakmap & other;
