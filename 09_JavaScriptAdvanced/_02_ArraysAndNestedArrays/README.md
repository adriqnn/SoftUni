# Arrays and Nested Arrays - Lecture

- Array -> list-like objects, reference type(addresses in memory), elements and numbered; length and types are not fixed, length can be changed and information is stored in non-contiguous locations;
- Accessing Elements in Array -> using indexes, iterating with loops and also accessing elements that dont exist returns undefined;
- Array Indexing -> using normal existing indexes within the array; using non-integer values(creates object properties instead of array elements);
- Destructuring Syntax -> expression that unpacks values from array into variables and can be use to collect values into an array(rest and spread - (...));
- Mutator Methods -> pop, push, shift, unshift, splice, fill and reverse;
- Sorting Arrays -> sort(); used to sort an array with compare function; regular behaviour of sort; localeCompare();
- Accessor Methods -> join, concat, slice, includes and indexOf;
- Iteration Methods -> foreach, map, some, find and filter;
- Reducing Array -> reduce(); has four arguments(accumulator, current value, current index(opt), source array(opt));
- Array of Arrays -> nested arrays in js;
