# Unit Testing and Error Handling - Lecture

* Error Handling -> an incorrectly working function/program should return a result that indicates a problem(special value or exception/error);
* Types of Errors -> syntax error, runtime error and logical error(bug);
* Throwing Errors -> general error, range error, type error, reference error & other errors;
* Try-Catch -> this statements test a block of code and handles any errors that might occur;
* Unit Testing -> piece of code that checks whether certain functionality works as expected; unit test structure is arrange, act and assert(AAA); unit testing frameworks;
* Modules -> set of functions to be included in applications, grouped and exposed to be used;
* Node.js Modules -> module.export internal modules and use require() to import in current file;
* Regular ES6 Imports -> used to simplify module imports;
