# Syntax Functions and Statements - Lecture

- JavaScript -> high-level language, executed on the server/client, multi-paradigm and dynamic typing(operation done at compile time can be done at run-time)(can change types of variables at run-time);
- Node.js -> server-side javascript runtime and npm package manager; 
- Visual Studio Code -> powerful text editor for javascript and other projects;
- Data Types & Variables -> primitive(string, number, boolean, undefined, null, bigint and symbol) and reference(object, array & other) types;
- Identifiers -> sequence of character that identifies variable, function or property;
- Variable Values -> used to store data values; variables that are assigned non-primitive values are given a reference; undefined(variable that has been declared but not given a value)/undeclared(variable that hasnt been declared);
- Variable Values -> let, const and var(hoisted);
- Variable Scopes -> global(variables that are not inside any function/block), functional(variable declared inside a function) & block scopes(variables declared with let and const);
- Functions -> named blocks of code(statements/expressions) can take parameters(can have default function parameters) and return result; invoking functions;
- Declaring Function -> function declaration, function expression & arrow functions;
- Standard Libraries -> Math, Number, Data, RegExp, JSON & other;
- Operators and Statements -> arithmetic operators(+, -, *, /, %, **), assignment operators(=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=), comparison operators(==, ===, !=, !==, >, >=, <, <=), conditional statements(if-else, switch) and logical operators(&&, ||, !);
- Truthy & Falsy -> truthy(a value that reduces to true) and falsy(false, null, undefined, NaN, 0, 0n and "");
- typeof -> returns a string indication the type of an operand;
- Loops -> for and while; for-of(used for arrays and iterators); for-in(used with objects and associative arrays);
- Debugging -> using strict mode in the ide('use strict'); using the debugger of the ide; breakpoints, stack-trace & inspect;
- Language Specifics -> type coercion, function and scope;
- First-class Functions -> functions can be passed as arguments to other functions; callbacks; functions assigned as variables;
- Nested Functions -> function can be inside other functions;
- Hoisting -> functions are hoisted(declared functions are ready during compile time) and variable hoisting(var);
