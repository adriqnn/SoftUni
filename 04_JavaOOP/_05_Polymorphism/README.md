# Polymorphism - Lecture

- Polymorphism -> allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type through method overriding, instanceof, casting, runtime(method overriding), compile time(method overloading);
- Polymorphism -> it enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (classes);
- Overloading -> methods(same class or inheritance but always different parameters), can have different return types;
- Overriding -> dynamic polymorphism, takes place in sub-class, same return types, modifiers cannot be more restrictive, private static and final methods cannot be overriden;
