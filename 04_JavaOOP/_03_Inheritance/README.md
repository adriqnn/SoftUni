# Inheritance - Lecture

* Inheritance -> superclass(parent/base class), subclass(child/derived class), hierarchies(iterable hierarchy), object class is the root of all classes;
* Inheritance -> extend(keyword), taking all members from another class, constructors are not inherited but can be reused with super(keyword) also for methods use, transitive relation, only one inheritance;
* Reusing Classes in Inheritance -> can access all public, protected and package private members, private fields are not inherited, child classes can hide parent class variables, a child class can override parent's existing methods that are not final;
* Final Classes -> cannot be inherited;
* Inheritance Benefits - abstraction(common properties), extension(can extend a class that we cannot change for our usage);
* Types of Class Reuse -> less chances of errors by not having duplicate code, reuse to extend, class composition(multiple other classes define a class);
* When to Use Inheritance -> is a relationship, is a substitute, same role, same as the superclass but needs more functionality;
