# Exceptions and Error Handling - Lecture
- What are Exceptions -> way to handle errors, objects, throwable, cause, message, stacktrace;
- Types of Exceptions -> inherit from throwable, error, exception;
- Exceptions -> checked(compile time) and unchecked(runtime);
- Handling Exceptions -> try-catch-finally blocks, multiple catch blocks;
- Throwing Exceptions -> throw, used to notify for error or unusual behaviour, travels to the top of the stack and throws an error if unhandled, message, information, rethrowing;
- Best Practices -> catching and handling exceptions in catch block that we expect and not just swallowing all of them, provide information, catching generic exceptions;
- Custom Exceptions -> extends exception, provides more information within the code;
