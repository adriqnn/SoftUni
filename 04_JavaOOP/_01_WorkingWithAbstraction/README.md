# Working with Abstraction - Lecture

- Project Architecture -> splitting code in methods(reusable, more readable)(single task) and classes(hiding implementation, avoid repeating code);
- Refactoring -> restructure the code without changing the behaviour, improve readability, reduce complexity, breaking the code into smaller units, extracting new methods and classes, improving names of variables, methods and classes, re-arranging the structure;
- Enumerations -> numeric value from a fixed set, start at 0, customizable values;
- Static Keyword -> for memory management, for(nested classes, variables, methods and blocks), belongs to the class and not an instance, only nested classes can be static;
- Static Variable -> referred as common variable for all objects;
- Static Method -> belongs to class and not instance, can be invoked without an instance, can access static members, cannot use non-static members, this and super cannot be used;
- Static Block -> set of statements that can be executed before the main method, executed from top to bottom;
- Packages -> group related classes and for better maintainability, libraries, can be imported to be used;
