# Interfaces and Abstraction - Lecture

* Abstraction -> preserves relevant information and forgets irrelevant information, focus on purpose and not execution, interfaces(100% abstraction) and abstract classes(0-100% abstraction);
* Abstraction vs. Encapsulation -> abstraction hides implementation details(interfaces and abstract classes) and encapsulation hides the code and data(access modifiers);
* Interfaces -> always public or default, can have static final fields, public abstract methods, interfaces can have default and static methods with body;
* Abstract Classes -> cannot be instantiated, must provide implementation for all inherited interface members, abstract methods(no implementation, forced children to implement);
* Implements vs. Extends -> class extends class, class implements interface, interface extends interface;
* Interfaces vs Abstract Classes -> many vs one inheritances, no access modifiers vs access modifiers, must implement methods in all classes vs providing implementation or just signature to override, abstract class can have fields and constants;
