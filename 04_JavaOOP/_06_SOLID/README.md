# SOLID - Lecture

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
* Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
