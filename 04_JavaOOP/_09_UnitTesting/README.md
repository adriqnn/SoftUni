# Unit Testing - Lecture 

* Seven Testing Principles -> testing is context dependent, exhaustive testing is not possible, early testing is always preferred, defects clustering, pesticide paradox, testing shows presence of defects, absence of errors is fallacy;
* What is Unit Testing -> a single responsibility(class) test, junit, packages for tests only, @test, 3A pattern(arrange, act and assert);
* Unit Testing Best Practices -> assertTrue(), assertEquals(), messages, naming of tests, hamcrest, use of constants, @before to setup, avoid code duplication, @after;
* Dependencies -> coupling and testing, dependency injection, mocking;
