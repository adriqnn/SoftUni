# Reflection and Annotation - Lecture 

* Reflection -> program treats program as their data(read, generate, analyze, transfer), maintenance, testing;
* Reflection API -> .class, .forName(className), .getName(), .getSimpleName(), .getSuperClass();
* Constructors, Fields and Methods -> reflection for constructors, parameters, instantiate objects, fields, name, type, access modifiers, getters, setters, methods;
* Access Modifiers -> can obtain information for the modifiers, annotations;
* Annotations -> hold data, describe part of the code, applied to classes fields and methods, to generate messages, code generation, documentation generation, testing, runtime, compile time;
* Annotation Types -> primitive types(int, long, boolean, etc.), String, Class, Enum, Annotation, Arrays;
* Annotation @Target -> where an annotation is applicable - constructor, field, local_variable, method , package, parameter, type;
* Annotation @Retention -> where annotation is available - source, class, runtime;
