# SOLID - Exercise

* Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):  -> A class should have only one reason to change/one responsibility;
* Open/Closed Principle (OCP): -> Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification(existing code);
* Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): -> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program;
* Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): -> Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use;
* Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): -> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions;
