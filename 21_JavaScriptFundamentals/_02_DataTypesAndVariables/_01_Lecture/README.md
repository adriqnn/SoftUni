# Data Types and Variables - Lecture

- var vs. let vs. const -> var(function scope), let(block scope); global scope, function scope and block scope;
- Naming Variables -> case sensitive, letter or underscore(_);
- Data Types -> primitive(boolean, null, undefined, number, string, symbol and bigint) and composite(objects); variables are dynamic and not associated with a particular value type;
- Typeof Operator -> returns the type of a variable or an expression;
- String -> represents textual data, an array of symbols; immutable; string interpolation;
- Numbers -> integer, float, double are all under the number;
- Booleans -> conditions, truthy and falsy values; boolean represents either true or false; comparison conditions, (==) equal without type and (===) equal with type; with value - true, without value - false;
- Undefined -> non-existent; no value = undefined and also can set variables to undefined; typeof undefined is undefined; declared and not defined; falsy; equal in value with null but different in type
- Null -> empty; something that doesnt exist; typeof null is an object; means nothing; falsy; equal in value with undefined but different in type;
