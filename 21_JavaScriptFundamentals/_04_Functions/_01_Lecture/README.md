# Functions - Lecture

* Function -> subprogram designed to perform a particular task(have parameters); camel-case; function invocation; always returns a value;
* Function -> can have no parameters on any number and type of parameters; nested functions;
* Function Declaration -> function declaration, function expression and arrow functions;
* Value vs Reference Types -> stack and heap; value type(number, string, boolean) and reference type(object and array - have memory address pointers);
* Declared Function -> A function in JavaScript defined using the function keyword with a function name, which can be accessed before its declaration due to hoisting;
* Function Expression -> A function defined as part of an expression, typically assigned to a variable, and is not accessible before its declaration due to lexical scoping;
* Arrow Function ->  A concise way to write functions in JavaScript using the => syntax, which inherits the this value from its surrounding context and does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target bindings;
