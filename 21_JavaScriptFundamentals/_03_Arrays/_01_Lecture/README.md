# Arrays - Lecture 

- Array -> sequence of elements; creating, accessing and assigning values; same data types and mixed ones(not recommended);
- Array Operations -> add, push, shift, unshift, pop and other;
- Array Methods -> includes, toString, join, reverse and other;
- Array Invalid Positions -> using invalid parameters leads to resizing/undefined elements and weird behaviour;
- Array Traversal -> for of, for loop and streams;
