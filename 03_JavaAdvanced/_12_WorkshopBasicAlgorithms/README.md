# Workshop Basic Algorithms - Lecture/Exercise

* Recursion -> method/function that calls itself, base case, per-action, recursive call, post-action, direct and indirect recursion;
* Brute-Force Algorithms -> trying all possible combination, slow and inefficient;
* Greedy Algorithms -> solving optimization problems, can produce incorrect result;
* Simple Sorting Algorithms -> elements must be comparable, sorted in non-decreasing order, recursive/non recursive,stable/unstable, comparison-based, insertion, eschange(bubble sort and quicksort), selection(heapsort), merging, serial/parallel and more;
* Searching Algorithms -> algorithm for finding an item from a collection of items, graph and loop, min/max, linear search(O(N)), binary search(O(log(N)));
